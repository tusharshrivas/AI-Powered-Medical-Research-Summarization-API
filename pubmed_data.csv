Title,Abstract
A Smart MMP-9-responsive Hydrogel Releasing M2 Macrophage-derived Exosomes for Diabetic Wound Healing.,"Chronic diabetic wounds are characterized by prolonged inflammation and excessive accumulation of M1 macrophages, which impede the healing process. Therefore, resolving inflammation promptly and transitioning to the proliferative phase are critical steps for effective diabetic wound healing. Exosomes have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, a smart hydrogel capable of responding to pathological cues in the inflammatory microenvironment to promote the transition from inflammation to proliferation by delivering M2 macrophage-derived exosomes (M2-Exos) is developed. The smart hydrogel is synthesized through the cross-linking of oxidized dextran, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9-sensitive peptide, and carboxymethyl chitosan containing M2-Exos. In response to elevated MMP-9 concentrations in the inflammatory microenvironment, the hydrogel demonstrates diagnostic logic, adjusting the release kinetics of M2-Exos accordingly. The on-demand release of M2-Exos facilitated macrophage polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting the transition from the inflammatory to the proliferative phase and accelerating diabetic wound healing. The transcriptomic analysis further reveals that the MMP-9-responsive hydrogel with M2-Exos delivery exerts anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects by downregulating inflammation-related pathways. This study introduces an innovative, microenvironment-responsive exosome delivery system that enables precise control of therapeutic agent release, offering a personalized approach for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds."

Targeting mTOR with curcumin: therapeutic implications for complex diseases.,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial enzyme in regulating multiple signaling pathways in the body, including autophagy, proliferation and apoptosis. Disruption of these mTOR signaling pathways can lead to an array of abnormalities and trigger disease processes, examples being neurodegenerative conditions, cancer, obesity and diabetes. Under conditions of oxidative stress, mTOR can regulate apoptosis and autophagy, with tissue repair being favored under such circumstances. Moreover, the correlation between mTOR and other signaling pathways could play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of numerous disorders. mTOR has a tight connection with NF-κB, Akt, PI3K, MAPK, GSK-3β, Nrf2/HO-1, JAK/STAT, CREB/BDNF, and ERK1/2 pathways, which together could play significant roles in the regulation of inflammation, apoptosis, cell survival, and oxidative stress in different body organs. Research suggests that inhibiting mTOR could be beneficial in treating metabolic, neurological and cardiovascular conditions, as well as potentially extending life expectancy. Therefore, identifying new chemicals and agents that can modulate the mTOR signaling pathway holds promise for treating and preventing these disorders. Curcumin is one such agent that has demonstrated regulatory effects on the mTOR pathway, making it an exciting alternative for reducing complications associated with complex diseases by targeting mTOR. This review aims to examine the potential of curcumin in modulating the mTOR signaling pathway and its therapeutic implications."
